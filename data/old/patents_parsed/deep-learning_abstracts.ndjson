In general, a one-hidden-layer neural network is trained first using labels discriminatively with error back-propagation (BP). Then, after discarding an output layer in the previous one-hidden-layer neural network, another randomly initialized hidden layer is added on top of the previously trained hidden layer along with a new output layer that represents the targets for classification or recognition. The resulting multiple-hidden-layer DNN is then discriminatively trained using the same strategy, and so on until the desired number of hidden layers is reached. This produces a pretrained DNN.

With the tremendous amount of information that becomes available on the Web on a daily basis, the ability to quickly develop information agents has become a crucial problem. A vital component of any Web-based information agent is a set of wrappers that can extract the relevant data from semistructured information sources. The novel approach to wrapped induction provided herein is based on the idea of hierarchical information extraction, which turns the hard problem of extracting data from an arbitrarily complex document into a series of easier extraction tasks. Labeling the training data represents the major bottleneck in using wrapper induction techniques, and experimental results show that STALKER performs significantly better than other approaches; on one hand, STALKER requires up to two orders of magnitude fewer examples than other algorithms, while on the other hand it can handle information sources that could not be wrapped by prior techniques.

["Method and agent network architecture for processing a subject message, where each agent has a view of its own domain of responsibility. An initiator agent which receives a user-input request and does not itself have a relevant interpretation policy, queries its downchain agents whether the queried agent considers such message to be in its domain of responsibility. Each queried agent recursively determines whether it has an interpretation policy of its own that applies to the request, and if not, further queries its own further downchain neighboring agents. The further agents eventually respond to such further queries, thereby allowing the first-queried agents to respond to the initiator agent. The recursive invocation of this procedure ultimately determines one or more paths through the network from the initiator agent to one more more leaf agents. The request is then transmitted down the path(s), with each agent along the way taking any local action thereon and passing the message on to the next agent in the path. In the event of a contradiction, the network is often able to resolve many of such contradictions according to predetermined algorithms.

["A computer module is interactively trained to recognize patterns of spectral or textural features in imagery. The interactively trained module is based on techniques of knowledge-based image processing and an approach that uses interest images to provide a means of continuous feedback of module performance to the user. The user, in turn, responds by indicating where the module is making mistakes. A set of user indicated examples and counter examples form the inputs to a machine learning program called Functional Template Learning. The trained module is exportable as an independent agent to search large databases for matching patterns. Following retrieval of images having matching patterns, a user can further refine the agent's performance by indicating where mistakes have been made. The overall search tool employing the trained module is capable of prescreening and highlighting images, significantly reducing the workload of analysts attempting to detect regions or objects in imagery.", "Machine learning apparatus and method for image searching "]
["Explicit representation of molecular shape of molecules is combined with neural network learning methods to provide models with high predictive ability that generalize to different chemical classes where structurally diverse molecules exhibiting similar surface characteristics are treated as similar. A new machine-learning methodology that can accept multiple representations of objects and construct models that predict characteristics of those objects. An extension of this methodology can be applied in cases where the representations of the objects are determined by a set of adjustable parameters. An iterative process applies intermediate models to generate new representations of the objects by adjusting said parameters and repeatedly retrains the models to obtain better predictive models.

The method also includes generating a data representation of a physical hydrocarbon reservoir can be generated in a non-transitory, computer-readable, medium based, at least in part, on the results of the simulation.", "Methods and Systems For Machine - Learning Based Simulation of Flow "]
["Split machine learning systems can be used to generate an output for an input. When the input is received, a determination is made as to whether the input is within a first, second, or third range of values. If the input is within the first range, the output is generated using a first machine learning system. If the input is within the second range, the output is generated using a second machine learning system. If the input is within the third range, the output is generated using the first and second machine learning systems.", "Split machine learning systems "]
["Techniques for determining forecast information for a resource using learning algorithms are disclosed. The techniques can include an ensemble of machine learning algorithms. The techniques can also use latent states to generate training data. The techniques can identify actions for managing the resource based on the forecast information. The resource can include energy usage in buildings, distribution facilities, and resources such as Electric Delivery Vehicles. The resource can also include forecasting package volume for businesses.", "Forecasting system using machine learning and ensemble methods "]
["Methods, systems and media are taught utilizing ranking techniques in machine learning to learn a ranking function. Specifically, ranking algorithms are applied to learn a ranking function that advantageously minimizes ranking error as a function of targeted ranking order discrepancies between a predetermined first ranking of a training plurality of data elements and a second ranking of the training plurality of data elements by the ranking function. The ranking algorithms taught may be applied to ranking representations of chemical structures and may be particularly advantageous in the field of drug discovery, e.g., for prioritizing chemical structures for drug screenings.", "Methods, Systems and Media Utilizing Ranking Techniques in Machine Learning "]
["The present application includes biomarkers, methods, devices, reagents, systems, and kits for the detection and diagnosis of lung cancer. In one aspect, the application provides biomarkers that can be used alone or in various combinations to diagnose lung cancer or permit the differential diagnosis of pulmonary nodules as benign or malignant. In another aspect, methods are provided for diagnosing lung cancer in an individual, where the methods include detecting, in a biological sample from an individual, at least one biomarker value corresponding to at least one biomarker selected from the group of biomarkers provided in Table 1, Col. 2, wherein the individual is classified as having lung cancer, or the likelihood of the individual having lung cancer is determined, based on the at least one biomarker value.", "Lung Cancer Biomarkers and Uses Thereof "]
