["A method is disclosed for allocating internal machine registers in a digital computer for use in storing values defined and referenced by a computer program. An allocator in accordance with the present invention constructs a interference graph having a node therein for the live range of each value defined by a computer program, and having an edge between every two nodes whose associated live ranges interfere with each other. The allocator models the register allocation process as a graph-coloring problem, such that for a computer having R registers, the allocator of the present invention iteratively attempts to R-color the interference graph. The interference graph is colored to the extent possible on each iteration before a determination is made that one or more live ranges must be spilled. After spill code has been added to the program to transform spilled live ranges into multiple smaller live ranges, the allocator constructs a new interference graph and the process is repeated.", "Digital computer register allocation and code spilling using interference graph coloring "]

["An integer programming formulation for weighted loop fusion is presented. Loop fusion is a well-known program transformation that has shown to be effective in reducing loop overhead and improving register and cache locality. Weighted loop fusion is the problem of finding a legal partition of loop nests into fusible clusters so as to minimize the total inter-cluster edge weights. Past work has shown that the weighted loop fusion problem is NP-hard. Despite the NP-hardness property, the present invention provides optimal solutions that may be found efficiently, in the context of an optimizing compiler, for weighted loop fusion problem sizes that occur in practice. An integer programming formulation for weighted loop fusion with a problem size (number of variables and constraints) that is linearly proportional to the size of the input weighted loop fusion problem is also presented.

Each guest system includes a guest operating system (OS). A resource requesting mechanism, preferably a driver, is installed within each guest OS and communicates with a resource scheduler included within the host system. If the host system needs any one the guest systems to relinquish some of the system resource it currently is allocated, then the resource scheduler instructs the driver within that guest system's OS to reserve more of the resource, using the guest OS's own, native resource allocation mechanisms. The driver thus frees this resource for use by the host, since the driver does not itself actually need the requested amount of the resource.

In one embodiment, a device driver generates a request for memory allocation in terms of an abstract memory address space. This abstract memory address space is also used by a bus manager to manage the allocation of memory. The driver forwards the request to the bus manager which can then allocate memory or translate the request to a second abstract memory address space used by a second bus manager.

["The present invention is a system for translating text from a first source language into a second target language. The system assigns probabilities or scores to various target-language translations and then displays or makes otherwise available the highest scoring translations. The source text is first transduced into one or more intermediate structural representations. From these intermediate source structures a set of intermediate target-structure hypotheses is generated. These hypotheses are scored by two different models: a language model which assigns a probability or score to an intermediate target structure, and a translation model which assigns a probability or score to the event that an intermediate target structure is translated into an intermediate source structure. Scores from the translation model and language model are combined into a combined score for each intermediate target-structure hypothesis. Finally, a set of target-text hypotheses is produced by transducing the highest scoring target-structure hypotheses into portions of text in the target language. The system can either run in batch mode, in which case it translates source-language text into a target language without human assistance, or it can function as an aid to a human translator.

The application writer's license includes identifying information such as the application writer's name as well as the application writer's public key.

The first computer then encrypts the message digest using the application writer's private key, such that the encrypted message digest is defined as a digital \"signature\" of the application writer. A software passport is then generated which includes the application writer's digital signature, the application writer's license and the binary code. The software passport is then distributed to a user using any number of software distribution models known in the industry. A user, upon receipt of the software passport, loads the passport into a computer which determines whether the software passport includes the application writer's license and digital signature. In the event that the software passport does not include the application writer's license, or the application writer's digital signature, then the user's computer system discards the software passport and does not execute the binary code. As an additional security step, the user's computer computes a second message digest for the software passport and compares it to the first message digest, such that if the first and second message digests are not equal, the software passport is also rejected by the user's computer and the code is not executed. If the first and second message digests are equal, the user's computer extracts the application writer's public key from the application writer's license for verification.

["A cryptographic method and apparatus are disclosed which transform a message or arbitrary length into a block of fixed length (128 bits) defined modification detection code (MDC). Although there are a large number of messages which result in the same MDC, because the MDC is a many-to-one function of the input, it is required that it is practically not feasible for an opponent to find them. In analyzing the methods, a distinction is made between two types of attacks, i.e., insiders (who have access to the system) and outsiders (who do not). The first method employs four encryption steps per DEA block and provides the higher degree of security. Coupling between the different DEA operations is provided by using the input keys also as data in two of the four encryption steps. In addition, there is cross coupling by interchanging half of the internal keys. Although this second coupling operation does not add to security in this scheme, it is mandatory in the second method, which employs only two encryption steps per DEA block to trade off security for performance. By providing key cross coupling in both schemes, an identical kernel is established for both methods. This has an implementation advantage since the first method can be achieved by applying the second method twice. The MDC, when loaded into a secure device, authorizes one and only one data set to be authenticated by the MDC, whereas methods based on message authentication codes or digital signatures involving a public key algorithm authorize a plurality of data sets to be authenticated.

["Attacks by computer viruses, worm programs, and other hostile software (\u2018malware\u2019), have become very serious problems for computer systems connected to large communication networks such as the Internet. One potential defence against such attacks is to employ diversity\u2014that is, making each copy of the attacked software different. However, existing diversity techniques do not offer sufficient levels of protection. The invention provides an effective diversity solution by applying tamper resistant software (TRS) encoding techniques, to the communications that take place between software components, with corresponding changes to the code handling those communications. These communications may include, for example, data passed between software routines via parameters or mutually accessible variables, light-weight messages, signals and semaphores passed between threads, and messages passed between software processes. Effective TRS encoding techniques include data-flow encoding and mass-data encoding techniques.", "Secure method and system for computer protection "]

["In a multi-domain computer system in which several processes are running, a composite lock provides mutually exclusive access to a resource. The composite lock has a back-end component and a front-end component. The back-end component is platform-dependent and operates as a semaphore, with Wait and Signal functions. The front-end component conditionally calls the Wait and Signal functions depending on whether the lock is currently contested when a new process wishes to acquire the lock, and on whether any process is currently suspended, waiting to acquire the lock. The front-end and back-end components may execute in different domains. In the uncontested case, the invention avoids costly domain crossings. The front-end component may also include a spinning feature to further reduce the need to invoke the back-end component and cause a domain crossing.

["Coding free text documents, especially in medicine, has become an urgent priority as electronic medical records (EMR) mature, and the need to exchange data between EMRs becomes more acute. However, only a few automated coding systems exist, and they can only code a small portion of the free text against a limited number of codes. The precision of these systems is low and code quality is not measured. The present invention discloses a process and system which implements semantic coding against standard lexicon(s) with high precision. The standard lexicon can come from a number of different sources, but is usually developed by a standard's body. The system is semi-automated to enable medical coders or others to process free text documents at a rapid rate and with high precision. The system performs the steps of segmenting a document, flagging the need for corrections, validating the document against a data type definition, and looking up both the semantics and standard codes which correspond to the document's sentences. The coder has the option to intervene at any step in the process to fix mistakes made by the system. A knowledge base, consisting of propositions, represents the semantic knowledge in the domain. When sentences with unknown semantics are discovered they can be easily added to the knowledge base. The propositions in the knowledge base are associated with codes in the standard lexicon. The quality of each match is rated by a professional who understands the knowledge domain. The system uses this information to perform high precision coding and measure the quality of the match.", "Process and system for high precision coding of free text documents against a standard lexicon "]

["In a Distributed Database System (DDS), database management and transaction management are extended to a distributed environment among a plurality of local sites which each have transaction server, file server, and data storage facilities. The Materialization and Access Planning (MAP) method of a distributed query, update, or transaction is an important part of the processing of the query, update, or transaction. Materialization and access planning results in a strategy for processing a query, update, or transaction in the distributed database management system (DSDBMS). Materialization consists of selecting data copies used to process the query, update, or transaction. This step is necessary since data may be stored at more than one site (i.e., computer) on the network. Access planing consists of choosing the execution order of operations and the actual execution site of each operation. Three access planning methods are used: General (Response), General (Total) and Initial Feasible Solution (IFS). For a distributed query, General (Response) and General (Total) decrease the communication cost and increase the local processing costs as compared to the IFS.", "Automated query optimization method using both global and parallel local optimizations for materialization access planning for distributed databases "]

["Existing software proposals for electronic payments can be divided into \"on-line\" schemes which require participation of a trusted party (the bank) in every transaction and are secure against overspending, and \"off-line\" schemes which do not require a third party and guarantee only that overspending is detected when vendors submit their transaction records to the bank (usually at the end of the day). A new \"hybrid\" scheme is proposed which combines the advantages of both \"on-line\" and \"off-line\" electronic payment schemes. It allows for control of overspending at a cost of only a modest increase in communication compared to the off-line schemes. The protocol is based on probabilistic polling. During each transaction, with some small probability, the vendor forwards information about this transaction to the bank. This enables the bank to maintain an accurate approximation of a customer's spending. The frequency of polling messages is related to the monetary value of transactions and the amount of overspending the bank is willing to risk. For transactions of high monetary value, the cost of polling approaches that of the on-line schemes, but for micropayments, the cost of polling is a small increase over the traffic incurred by the off-line schemes.", "Efficient micropayment system "]
["Apparatus for developing and verifying systems. The disclosed apparatus employs a computationally-tractable technique for verifying whether a system made up of a set of processes, each of which has at least one delay constraint associated with it, satisfies a given temporal property. The technique deals with the verification as a language inclusion problem, i.e., it represents both the set of processes and the temporal property as automata and determines whether there is a restriction of the set of processes such that the language of the automaton representing the restricted set of processes is included in the language of the automaton representing the temporal property. The technique is computationally tractable because it deals with the problem iteratively: it tests whether a current restriction of the set of processes is included, and if not, it employs a counter-example for the inclusion to either determine that the delay constraints render satisfaction of the given temporal property or to derive a new restriction of the set of processes.

["A practical mathematical algorithm is used to solve the so-called \"File Assignment Problem\" (FAP). The FAP is partitioned into two sequential optimization problems, called the macro model and the micro model. The macro model is solved by a Non-Linear Programming Model (NLPM) and a Queuing Network Model (QNM). The NLPM takes as input detailed information on the computer system configuration and performance characteristics down through the DASD level, and, using the QNM as its objective function evaluator, determines the \"optimal\" DASD relative access rates as output. The micro model is solved by a Binary Linear Programming Model (BLPM), although the QNM is also involved to help determine the BLPM stopping criteria. The input to the micro model consists basically of the output from the macro model, together with statistics on the access rates of the various files in the computer system. The output from the optimization is an \"optimal\" assignment of files to DASDs. The micro model algorithm can be utilized in either an unlimited file movement mode or a limited file movement mode, the former being used when the computer system undergoes a major reconfiguration while the latter is used on a once per week basis. The BLPM is solved by a \"neighborhood escape\" type heuristic. The procedure provides a real-world, practical solution to the FAP resulting in significant increases in performance.", "Assignment of files to storage device using macro and micro programming model which optimized performance of input/output subsystem "]

["Method and agent network architecture for processing a subject message, where each agent has a view of its own domain of responsibility. An initiator agent which receives a user-input request and does not itself have a relevant interpretation policy, queries its downchain agents whether the queried agent considers such message to be in its domain of responsibility. Each queried agent recursively determines whether it has an interpretation policy of its own that applies to the request, and if not, further queries its own further downchain neighboring agents. The further agents eventually respond to such further queries, thereby allowing the first-queried agents to respond to the initiator agent. The recursive invocation of this procedure ultimately determines one or more paths through the network from the initiator agent to one more more leaf agents. The request is then transmitted down the path(s), with each agent along the way taking any local action thereon and passing the message on to the next agent in the path. In the event of a contradiction, the network is often able to resolve many of such contradictions according to predetermined algorithms. If it cannot resolve a contradiction automatically, it learns new interpretation policies necessary to interpret the subject message properly.

["The subject invention leverages a scalable character glyph hash table to provide an efficient means to identify print characters where the character glyphs are identical over independent presentation. The hash table allows for quick determinations of glyph meta data as, for example, a pre-filter to traditional OCR techniques. The hash table can be trained for a particular environment, user, language, character set (e.g., alphabet), document type, and/or specific document and the like. This permits substantial flexibility and increases in speed in identifying unknown glyphs. The hash table itself can be composed of single or multiple tables that have a specific optimization purpose. In one instance of the subject invention, traditional OCR techniques can be utilized to update the hash tables as needed based on glyph frequency. This keeps the hash tables from growing by limiting updates that reduce its performance, while adding frequently determined glyphs to increase the pre-filter performance.", "Scalable hash-based character recognition "]

["An organization's data records are often noisy: because of transcription errors, incomplete information, and lack of standard formats for textual data. A fundamental task during data cleansing and integration is matching strings\u2014perhaps across multiple relations\u2014that refer to the same entity (e.g., organization name or address). Furthermore, it is desirable to perform this matching within an RDBMS, which is where the data is likely to reside. In this paper, We adapt the widely used and established cosine similarity metric from the information retrieval field to the relational database context in order to identify potential string matches across relations. We then use this similarity metric to characterize this key aspect of data cleansing and integration as a join between relations on textual attributes, where the similarity of matches exceeds a specified threshold. Computing an exact answer to the text join can be expensive. For query processing efficiency, we propose an approximate, sampling-based approach to the join problem that can be easily and efficiently executed in a standard, unmodified RDBMS. Therefore the present invention includes a system for string matching across multiple relations in a relational database management system comprising generating a set of strings from a set of characters, decomposing each string into a subset of tokens, establishing at least two relations within the strings, establishing a similarity threshold for the relations, sampling the at least two relations, correlating the relations for the similarity threshold and returning all of the tokens which meet the criteria of the similarity threshold.", "Text joins for data cleansing and integration in a relational database management system "]

["In a computing environment containing a plurality of state machines that communicate by passing messages on connections, a construct called a clique controls access into a set of the state machines by worker threads that deliver the messages arriving on the connections. A clique is a collection of connections into the set of the state machines that have a common relationship for which concurrency isolation is required. Each clique has a message queue and a guard for marking the clique as busy or not busy, The guard prevents more than one thread at a time from delivering messages that arrive on connections in the clique to the set of state machines, thus ensuring concurrency isolation of the set of state machines. Messages that arrive on a connection in the clique while the clique is marked as busy are queued in the clique's message queue. The queued messages are delivered one at a time by a same worker thread that is currently busy in the clique. This operation can save a thread switch when a state machine generates an outgoing message that results in an immediate incoming message to the state machine, such as a buffer full message, and thus makes efficient use of the worker threads.", "Concurrency control of state machines in a computer system using cliques "]

["Multiple applications request data from multiple storage units over a computer network. The data is divided into segments and each segment is distributed randomly on one of several storage units, independent of the storage units on which other segments of the media data are stored. Redundancy information corresponding to each segment also is distributed randomly over the storage units. The redundancy information for a segment may be a copy of the segment, such that each segment is stored on at least two storage units. The redundancy information also may be based on two or more segments. This random distribution of segments of data and corresponding redundancy information improves both scalability and reliability. When a storage unit fails, its load is distributed evenly over to remaining storage units and its lost data may be recovered because of the redundancy information. When an application requests a selected segment of data, the request may be processed by the storage unit with the shortest queue of requests.

["The processors in a multiprocessor computer system are grouped into nodes. The processors can request a lock, but the lock is granted to only one processor at any given time to provide exclusive processor access to the resource protected by the lock. When a processor releases the lock, the lock is made available to another processor at the same node, even though a processor at a different node may have requested the lock earlier. To maintain fairness, the lock is forced to another node after granting a certain number of consecutive requests at a node or after a certain time period. In one embodiment, a specialized data structure representing a lock request from a processor at a particular node is placed into a queue. A later requesting processor can acquire a preemptive position in the queue by spinning on a data structure already in the queue if the data structure corresponds to the processor's node. To maintain fairness, the data structure is limited to a certain number of uses, after which additional processors are not permitted to spin on it. When the data structure has no more active spinners, it is dequeued, and the lock is made available to a processor spinning on the next structure in the queue. Logic for handling interrupts is included, and the bitfield arrangement of the data structure is tailored to the locking scheme. Preallocating data structures for the queue increases performance.", "Lingering locks with fairness control for multi-node computer systems "]

["A secure hash function according to the present invention uses a stretch function 202 and a compression function 202 to provide a secure hash value. A stretch function is a function which increases an input string (pre-image). In one version of the invention, a stretch function \u0192 maps l-bit inputs into 2m bit, where 2m>l.

["A system and method for geometric modeling particularly useful for conceptual design in a mechanical CAD system. Geometric modeling includes not only geometric information, but other engineering and design constraints as well. The present method solves this geometric constraint satisfaction problem using graph based solution techniques. Constraints are graph sources of dimensional, translational, and rotational degrees of freedom while the geometric entities in the model are graph sinks. The method generates an ordered dependency list of geometric entities by allocating degrees of freedom according to a geometric entity's ability to absorb them. The ordered dependency list is used as an execution sequence if a constraint is changed. If a constraint or geometric entity is added or deleted from the model, the ordered dependency list is recomputed. A modeler can thus conceptualize incremental changes in the model while satisfying the imposed constraints. Because the computational complexity is linearly related to the problem complexity, the graph based method is well suited to incrementally modeling complex geometric problems--particularly 3D geometry--in a robust fashion.", "Modeling method for sorting dependencies among geometric entities "]

["Processes for selecting, manipulating and arranging data points or pixels derived from information bearing signals are useful to reduce the bandwidth of, or improve the perceived quality of, such a signal as transmitted and displayed. The techniques utilize time-varying sampling schemes and take into account the characteristics of the human visual system. For each information frame, a subset (3) of all possible data points (1) is selected (2). A further subset of active data points (5) is selected (4) for which data will actually be sampled. The active points (5) are further divided (6) into points for which a value will be transmitted (x-points) (7) and points which will be sampled but for which no separate value will be transmitted (o-points) (8). A mathematical association between the x-points and o-points is made (9) and new values to be transmitted are calculated for the x-points (10).

The conversion may be performed by comparing a small region of the scan to the corresponding region in the contralateral hemisphere, quantifying the degree of relative difference using statistical techniques, and representing this quantity of relative difference in a two dimensional or three dimensional relative difference map. In exemplary embodiments the method involves assigning an axis or plane of symmetry to a medical image, computing, using the image data, at least one relative difference map based on a comparison of two substantially symmetrical areas around the axis of symmetry, and generating a representation of any relative difference between the two symmetrical areas. In exemplary embodiments of the present invention the 3D orientation of a volumetric representation of an organ or anatomical area can be realigned within a scanner co-ordinate system. An inertia matrix can be computed on the sampled organ or structure, and principal axes can be can be derived from the eigenvectors of the inertia matrix.

The methodology defines the electrostatic complement for a given target site and geometry. The electrostatic complement may be used with steric complement for the target site to discover ligands through explicit construction and through the design or bias of combinatorial libraries. The definition of an electrostatic complement, i.e., the optimal tradeoff between unfavorable desolvation energy and favorable interactions in the complex, has been discovered to be useful in ligand design. This methodology essentially inverts the design problem by defining the properties of the optimal ligand based on physical principles. These properties provide a clear and precise standard to which trial ligands may be compared and can be used as a template in the modification of existing ligands and the de novo construction of new ligands.
