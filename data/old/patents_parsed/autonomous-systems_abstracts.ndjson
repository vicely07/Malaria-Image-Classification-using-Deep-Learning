The monitoring service receives as input(s) configuration data input from one or more site(s) that desire to obtain the service, as well as BGP feed data received from a set of data collectors positioned at or adjacent BGP peering points. For every origin (IP space) being monitored, a monitoring application monitors a set of allowed or permitted originating Autonomous System (AS) numbers for that space.

["The present invention describes a \u201ccompanion\u201d to an existing router that is multi-homed to transit Autonomous Systems (TASs) to a plurality of destination Autonomous Systems (DASs). The mechanism includes a path testing process that conducts local traffic analysis of outgoing packets transmitted from the mechanism to a set of IP addresses across different DASs that may be selected by an operator via a configuration file or suitable interface (e.g., GUI, CLI, or the like). To perform path testing via a particular link and transit AS, the path testing process temporarily inserts (into the router configuration) more specific overriding test routes to which to send the ping traffic. Following the test, the test routes are withdrawn from the router configuration. The data collected by this scanning process is then supplied to a path evaluation process, which is a decision algorithm for evaluating path quality for each TAS/DAS pair. A path whose quality is below a configurable threshold is a candidate for re-routing. A path selection process either recommends or, if enabled, executes path changes, e.g., by logging into the router and entering a new policy configuration. This has the effect of telling the router to reevaluate all routes heard from the selected TAS in view of the new policy.

["In a communications-networking autonomous system consisting of an OSPF domain, autonomous-system border routers (I-ASBR and E-ASBR) cause exchange of hierarchical forwarding labels whose hierarchies are based on OSPF areas. A border router transmits into the domain an OSPF LSA Update message containing an AS-External LSA whose External Route Tag field other routers interpret as specifying a label to be used for forwarding. When that LSA is flooded into the OSPF domain, area border routers respond by flooding new LSAs created from the received one by replacing the label contained in the External Route Tag field with labels that specify their forwarding tables' locations containing information for forwarding to the originating autonomous system border router. In so doing, they enable packets destined for an extra-domain location to be forwarded through the autonomous system without requiring non-border routers to allocate labels to the exterior location or to border routers outside their areas.

["IP based networks use a number of different IP routing protocols to determine how packets ought to be routed. However, due to the rapid growth of the Internet, there is a great need for higher packet forwarding performance. This invention describes a way to map IP routing information onto a technology that uses label switching and swapping, such as ATM, without the need to change the network paradigm. This allows a network to continue to function and appear as a standard IP network, but with much higher performance. In this invention, an Integrated Switch Router (ISR), is a switch that has been augmented with standard IP routing support. The ISR at an entry point to the switching environment performs standard IP forwarding of datagrams, but the \"next hop\" of the IP forwarding table has been extended to include a reference to a switched path (for example, the VCC in ATM technology). Each switched path may have an endpoint at a neighboring router (comparable to existing IP next hops on conventional routers), or may traverse a series of ISRs along the best IP forwarding path, to an ISR endpoint. This allows datagrams to be switched at hardware speeds through an entire ISR network.", "Mapping of routing traffic to switching networks "]
