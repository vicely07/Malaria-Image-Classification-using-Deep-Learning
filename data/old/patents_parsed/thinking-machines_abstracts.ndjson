["The invention describes Thinking Search Engines, a novel search technology that uses the data representation, problem solving and learning from experience techniques of Thinking Machines of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/204,346 by the author. Thinking Search Engines process documents and obtain their subjects in terms of the entities, templates, problems, concerns, solutions, and protocols that they describe whether or not these subjects are explicitly mentioned. They provide an initial ranking of search results by estimating the relative amount of information that each document contains for each of its subjects. During a search session, the machine records various data such as the address of the client machine, the files requested for each search query, the sequence, the elapsed time prior to each request, and the type of action that follows a request in the Session Information Table. Whenever a search session expires, its data is processed to populate the Experience Table of the Thinking Database. In turn, the experience data is used to tune the ranking of resulting files. The Thinking Search Engine also generates sponsoring links that are useful to users without competing with the products and services of the hosting site. Matching topics for sponsoring links are obtained by selecting from the Protocol Table of the Thinking Database all protocols and templates that use those of the hosting sites. Then the protocols and templates of the hosting site are eliminated to avoid competition. The remaining ones are the matching criteria for generating sponsoring links.", "Thinking search engines "]

["A method and apparatus are disclosed for using cellular automata to simulate systems described by partial differential equations such as those that describe the flow of fluid, diffusion or heat transfer. A two-dimensional space is tessellated into a cellular array of regular hexagons. Flow or diffusion into a cell through each of its six sides from each of its six nearest neighbor cells is represented by a value 1; and any other condition is represented by a value 0. A set of rules specifies the effect of such inward flow in terms of an outward flow through at least some of the same six sides of each cell to its nearest neighbors. Interaction of the flow with a surface or other inhomogeneity is simulated by using a different set of rules to specify the outward flow produced when an inward flow encounters a surface or other inhomogeneity in the cell. Outward flow from one cell is an inward flow into its nearest neighbors; and with the next \"tick\" of the clock of the mode, the cycle repeats itself. Over long periods of time such as tens of thousands of ticks of the clock, this process has been shown to simulate the flow of a real fluid against an inclined straight-edge.", "Method and apparatus for simulating systems described by partial differential equations "]
["Propositional reasoning is performed on a massively parallel processor, with sets of element value combinations being handled by separate processing units. A host processor operates as a problem solver generating requests for propositional reasoning, and also operates as an interface between the problem solver and the parallel processor. In response to a request that includes a formula, the interface provides one or more formulas such as justifications and class restrictions. The interface provides instructions to the parallel processor based on each of these formulas. The instruction based on each formula are provided so that the set of element value combinations handled by each processing unit is not divided or forked into two subsets until necessary. If possible, forking is avoided by forcing the value of an element to the only value consistent with the current formula. Furthermore, if no additional processing unit is available for forking, the current formula is kept on a queue of formulas, and the corresponding instructions are subsequently repeated. In this manner, the host processor orders the formulas into a sequence that reduces the number of processing units required. When necessary, a selected assumption is forced to one value to free processing units; its other value is considered subsequently by backtracking. Each element value is assigned one or more bit positions in each processing unit, but when the values in all the processing units are the same for a given element, its bit position may be reclaimed, to reduce memory requirements. The interface also responds to a request for results by sending instructions that use circuitry in the parallel processor to obtain a combined result from the processing units.", "Massively parallel propositional reasoning "]

["A body of data is operated upon hierarchically in such a way that, at one or more levels of the hierarchy, the number of aggregative data items produced is not substantially less than the number produced at the preceding level. The body of data can be an image, so that each aggregative data item indicates an attribute of a distinct image region. Such attributes include presence of a single connected component or properties of a component such as width, orientation and curvature. A class of abstract computation structures, called exhaustive hierarchical structures, is introduced in which such dense or exhaustive hierarchical aggregative data analysis processes can be embedded. The embedding of exhaustive hierarchical analysis in a computation structure of this class is analogous, and in some implementations similar in processing efficiency, to the embedding of conventional hierarchical aggregative data analysis processes in tree structures. The exhaustive hierarchical embedding introduced analyzes extensively overlapping regions in a manner that places minimum demands on the number of communication links, memory resources, and computing power of the individual processing units. Specifically, the embedding scheme is a general scheme for mapping locations in an array into nodes at two adjacent levels of a binary exhaustive hierarchical structure. The scheme establishes positional relations in the array that correspond to parent-child relations at a given level in the exhaustive hierarchical computing structure; these positional relations are uniform power-of-two offsets in each array dimension at a given hierarchical level. Consequently, this exhaustive hierarchical analysis can be implemented efficiently using conventional communication techniques, including hypercube and grid techniques, on a massively parallel processor. To minimize memory requirements, hierarchical results at each location can be encoded across all levels.", "Dense aggregative hierarhical techniques for data analysis "]

["The present invention provides a parallel vector machine model for building a compiler that exploits three different levels of parallelism found in a variety of parallel processing machines, and in particular, the Connection Machine\u00ae Computer CM-2 system. The fundamental idea behind the parallel vector machine model is to have a target machine that has a collection of thousands of vector processors each with its own interface to memory. Thus allowing a fine-grained array-based source program to be mapped onto a course-grained hardware made up of the vector processors. In the parallel vector machine model used by CM Fortran 1.0, the FPUs, their registers, and the memory hiearchy are directly exposed to the compiler. Thus, the CM-2 target machine is not 64K simple bit-serial processors. Rather, the target is a machine containing 2K PEs (processing elements), where each PE is both superpipelined and superscalar. The compiler uses data distribution to spread the problem out among the 2K processors. A new compiler phase is used to separate the code that runs on the two types of processors in the CM-2; the parallel PEs, which execute a new RISC-like instruction set called PEAC, and the scalar front end processor, which executes SPARC or VAX assembler code. The pipelines in PEs are filled by using vector processing techniques along the PEAC instruction set. A scheduler overlaps the execution of a number of RISC operations.", "System and method for compiling a fine-grained array based source program onto a course-grained hardware "]

The physical grid is divided into subgrids of equal size by dividing each expanded axis length into subgrid lengths of equal length. The lengths and numbers of subgrid lengths in each axis are then output to the compiler or the application program. From the subgrid lengths, the compiler or application program can identify a unique location in one of the subgrids given any location of an element in the array.

Decision making in general and specifically classification where decision trees are common, is a problem eased by SIMIMD. A SIMD array processor having a plurality of pickets in SIMIMD mode allows each picket to occasionally execute data-dependent instructions that are different from the instructions in other pickets to greatly improve execution efficiency in decision making areas.

Here several mechanisms allow an array machine with individual processing elements, called pickets, to interpret some of the SIMD commands in their own unique way, giving each picket a degree of local autonomy. A resulting capability allows the pickets to execute instructions in a mode called SIMIMD. Another resulting capability boosts the performance of executing floating-point instructions significantly. Yet another capability provides for GROUPING of pickets in various useful ways such that a combination of groups can be executing SIMD instructions while others are DOZING. There are other resulting capabilities. The SIMD machine is used alone or as part of multiprocessor parallel array processor computing systems and for parallel array processing with a simplified architecture adaptable to chip implementation in an air-cooled environment.

["A low latency network receive interface reduces the copying of message data by directly coupling the network to a cache and by providing an address-based message in which an incoming message block preincorporates an address so that messages can be directly stored in their final destination. In a preferred embodiment, the message data size is made equal to the cache block size so that cache blocks can be updated atomically. The small message size--which is equivalent in size to a cache block--also reduces transfer time, unlike Direct Memory Access (DMA) approaches in which a large amount of data must accumulate prior to transfer to main memory as a block. In one embodiment, the cache to which message data is directly coupled is divided into a message cache and a data cache, with the incoming message block coupled directly to the message cache. When an incoming message arrives, its address is compared with addresses in the data cache, with the data in the data cache at this address being purged in an invalidation process if the particular address is priorly occupied. The processor first accesses the data cache, and if no valid data exists at the corresponding address, it accesses the memory cache, which is in turn followed by accessing main memory if no valid cache data exists.

["Characteristics of images such as skew of lines of text or dominant typeface of characters are detected by producing distance data. Distance data is produced for each of a number of starting pixels within an image. Each starting pixel meets a criterion, such as an edge pixel or a pixel inside a connected component. Each starting pixel's distance data indicates the distance in each of a number of directions from the starting pixel to another pixel at which the image meets another criterion. For example, to detect skew of lines of text, the distance data can indicate distance from a starting pixel at an edge across white pixels to another edge. To detect dominant typeface, the distance data can indicate distance from a starting pixel at an edge or inside a connected component across black pixels to another edge. The separating angle between adjacent directions can be small enough to detect features of an appropriate size at an appropriate distance, such as features of character size at the average intercharacter spacing. The distances at each direction from all the starting pixels can be averaged to obtain a combined distance at each direction. A sufficient number of starting pixels can be used so that the combined distance is approximately the same as if every pixel in the image were a starting pixel.

Each substrate has count logic for counting the processing units whose data indicates a combination of values that could be consistent with constraints being applied, each of which has a valid bit indicating that it could be consistent. The counts are transferred to each connected substrate, and the transfer decision logic at each substrate determines, for each connected substrate, whether to transmit data, receive data, or neither transmit nor receive. The transfer decision logic decides to transfer data only if there are sufficient valid processing units on one substrate and sufficient invalid processing units on the other substrate to ensure that the transfer will succeed.

["There is disclosed herein a CRC calculation circuit which can calculate CRC checkbits on 8 bits of raw input data per cycle of a byte clock. The calculation apparatus uses 8 rows of shifting links with the inputs of each row coupled to the data outputs of the preceding row. Each shifting link shifts its input bit one bit position toward the most significant bit, and selected shifting links perform an exclusive OR operation between their input bits and the output of an input exclusive-OR gate which exclusive-OR's one input bit with one of the bits in the most significant byte of the checksum register. A byte wide output bus is used to access the final checkbits from the checksum register by disabling the array of shifting links during the output cycles so that the bytes of CRC data can be shifted into position through the array one byte per each cycle of the byte clock. Preset logic for forcing all logic 1's into the data inputs of the first row of shifting links is provided such the machine can be preset during the first clock cycle of the CRS calculation. Several different architectures are disclosed for allowing separate calculation of CRC bits on a header packet and a data packet where the CRC bits on the data packet may be calculated on the data alone or the data plus the header and the CRC bits for the header. Logic for allowing CRC calculation to be performed on all bytes of a message while excluding some selected number of bits in the first byte is also disclosed.", "CRC calculation machine with variable bit boundary "]
["A word-processing system or memory typewriter has the usual keyboard, input display and/or printer; together with a spelling dictionary stored within the memory, and an error signal generating device activated upon entry of an incorrect word. For greater efficiency and ease of use by the operator, the memory also stores several kinds of correction information--e.g., typographical correction, transposition reversal, phonetic substitutions, etc.--suitable for amending the incorrect word to display a trial word which matches one from the above-mentioned stored dictionary, the amending occurring by depression of a special key whenever entry of an incorrect word activates the error-signal device. Statistical control of selection of the class of correction information is provided, the order of utilization of the various classes depending upon the relative extent of the operator's prior successful usage of each class of information. If the trial word displayed is not satisfactory, the operator can depress the usual Index key 20I on the keyboard for presentation of yet another amended word matching the contents of the dictionary, and so on until the operator is satisfied with the one presented and signals the system to print that choice. If a match cannot be obtained with any of the information, the display indicates this fact to the operator.", "Word processor having spelling corrector adaptive to operator error experience "]

["The present invention provides a constrained stochastic dynamical method for simulating the motion of a molecular system. The method simulates the motions of atoms within the molecular system by evaluating first order force expressions for all the atoms over a series of time steps. The force expressions include terms for frictional forces, non-covalently interatomic forces, thermal noise forces, and covalent constraining forces. Relatively long time steps can be used because the fast motions (such as vibrations associated with covalent bonds) are not explicitly considered. Rather, the fast molecular motions associated with covalent bonds are averaged around their equilibrium bond lengths and, in some cases, bond angles. This is implemented by introducing (1) thermal noise forces, and (2) constraining forces fixing the relative positions of some atoms based upon their covalent bonds.

["A method of (and related apparatus for) pipelining the execution of selected operations in an n-dimensional array of processor cells having at least 2n nodes with at least one processor per node. Each processor cell includes memory means and a processor element for producing an output depending at least in part of data read from said memory means and instruction information supplied to the cell. Each processor cell is identified by an address in the array, which specifies the location of the processor cell within the dimensionality of the array. The array is operated so as to provide processing time slots during which the processor cells execute said operations and communications time slots during which the processors transmit information to each other. During each communications time slot, each processor can receive one bit of data from only one other processor (i.e., the preceding stage) along an edge dimension ''d'' of the n-cube; and each processor can transmit only one bit of data to only one other processor, along edge dimension d + 1. A data value for an element of an input data array is supplied to the memory of each node. Then for each of a series of successive time slots, each of a set of first processor cells executes said operation on a selected bit of the argument in the memory of its node, in accordance with a bit received from a first other processor cell, and transmits the result of said operation to a second other processor cell, until the final result appears at a predetermined node. The computation (i.e., selected operation) performed by the processors is identical for all processors, but may be conditional. Algorithms which can be converted into an appropriate form for pipelining in this fashion include those which (1) can be implemented by sending information along only one dimension in the array at a time and (2) send information along successive dimensions whose dimension numbers form an arithmetic sequence. Further, for an algorithm to be appropriate for (i.e., efficiently suited for) such pipelining, it must be possible to start performing the underlying computation without having all \"M\" bits of the data words available.

["DRAM speed of operation in an Error Catch RAM can be increased by a combination of interleaving signals for different Banks of memory in a Group thereof and multiplexing between those Groups of Banks. A three-way multiplexing between three Groups of four Banks each, combined with a flexible four-fold interleaving scheme for signals to a Group produces an increase in speed approaching a factor of twelve, while requiring only three memory busses. Each of the twelve Banks represents the entire available address space, and any individual write cycle might access any one of the twelve Banks. A utility mechanism composes results for all twelve Banks during a read cycle at an address into a unified result. There is a mechanism to track of the integrity of the composed results, as further write operations can produce the need for another composing step. There are four Memory Sets, two are \u201cinternal\u201d SRAM's and two are \u201cexternal\u201d DRAM's. The SRAM's are integral parts of VLSI circuits, while the DRAM's are individual packaged parts adjacent that VLSI. The amount of DRAM is optional. For DRAM memory sets the multiplexing and interleaving mode allows full random access at speeds of up to 100 MHz. For speeds will not exceed 33 MHz, the DRAM's can be configured to provide three times the depth in return for the lower speed by removing the multiplexing between Groups in favor of just interleaving upon one larger Group; Bank enable bits that were used as part of the multiplexing can now be used as regular address bits to increase the size of the address space of the one Group that remains. If the testing to the DUT fits the \u201clinear\u201d mode of access, a twelve-fold increase in memory depth is available, even when the DUT is tested at the highest speed the tester can operate at. This eliminates the interleaving scheme in favor of addressing within a single Bank at a time. Another reconfiguration is to combine the external memory sets into one memory set that has twice the depth of either uncombined set, regardless of other (i.e., the speed related) modes of operation.", "Error catch RAM for memory tester has SDRAM memory sets configurable for size and speed "]
["Compositions, methods, and systems for manufacturing articles, particularly containers and packaging materials, having a fiber-reinforced, starch-bound cellular matrix. Suitable mixtures used to form the articles are prepared by first preparing a viscous preblended mixture comprising water, a gelatinized starch-based binder, and fibers having an average length greater than about 2 mm. The highly viscous preblended mixture effectively transfers the shearing forces of the mixer to the fibers. The final moldable mixture is then prepared by mixing into the preblended mixture the remaining starch-based binder, water, and other desired admixtures, e.g., mold-releasing agents, inorganic filler rheology-modifying agents, plasticizers, coating materials, and dispersants, in the correct proportions to form an article which has the desired performance criteria. The moldable mixtures are heated between molds at an elevated temperature and pressure to produce form-stable articles having a desired shape and a selectively controlled foamed structural matrix.

["A system and method for reducing the cost of framing network packets in a virtual machine environment combines certain network objects to eliminate the cost of fully framing packets between the combined objects. In a virtual environment, for example, this allows a virtual NIC in one partition to send only data to a network provider partition and to rely on the latter to frame and route the data. A source network object, destination network object, or an intermediate network object may enable a separate intermediate network object to frame its data so that the network system may take advantage of offload framing when one or more of the intermediate network object's ports has the capacity to offload framing. Alternatively, the intermediate network object may perform the offload itself. Also, the source or destination network object may query the intermediate network object for properties (such as the MTU of the network), or the intermediate network object may push its properties to the source and/or destination network objects through a back control data communications channel. The intermediate network object may further reconfigure the VM network for the purpose of efficiency by reconfiguring the network tree into a graph for increased performance for traffic moving between the nodes.", "Enhanced network system through the combination of network objects "]
["An apparatus for injecting errors into a FDDI token ring network is disclosed. The error injection scheme operates by fooling a FORMAC into thinking it sent a real frame of data. This is done by using two RAM buffers. The RAM buffer normally accessed by the RBC/DPC becomes a SHADOW RAM during error injection operation. A dummy frame is loaded into the shadow RAM in order to fool the FORMAC. This data is just like the data that would be used if sending a normal frame, with the restriction that it must be shorter than the error injection data. The other buffer, the error injection RAM, contains the error injection frame. The error injection data is sent out to the media by switching a multiplexor. When the FORMAC is done transmitting the data, the multiplexor is switched back to the normal mode. Thus, the FORMAC is unaware of what happened and the token ring remains operational.", "FDDI network test adaptor error injection circuit "]

["A method for avoiding time-outs during facsimile transmissions over IP networks is disclosed. In the disclosed method, T.30 commands and responses are passed in V.21 channel 2 (\u201cch2\u201d) modulation with HDLC framing. Normally, when a T.30 message is sent, the V.21 ch2 carrier starts, then there is one second of HDLC flags, followed by the contents of the message. In a method according to the present invention, the V.21 ch2 carrier and HDLC flags are started when a response is late from the remote facsimile machine. This step is preferably initiated on occasions when a time-out would otherwise be likely in view of the late response. If the response from the remote facsimile machine arrives during the one second HDLC flags, the message is sent to the remote facsimile normally. If the message has not been received by the end of the one second HDLC flags, this period is extended for an additional two seconds. If the response arrives during this extended period of HDLC flags, the message is sent immediately. This HDLC flags preamble extension method avoids time-outs by making the facsimile machine think the message is being received, rather than doing a time consuming restart.", "Method and apparatus for improving performance of facsimile transmissions over IP networks "]

["Near neighbor data is produced hierarchically for each pixel of an image. Each pixel's near neighbor data indicates the presence of an approximate near neighbor pixel in each of four quadrants with respect to the pixel, and can also indicate distance and orientation to the near neighbor pixel. The near neighbor data can be produced by parallel processing units, with each processing unit producing, for a respective pixel, a near neighbor data item at every level of the hierarchy. Each near neighbor data item can indicate the presence of an approximate near neighbor in a respective region of the image. A near neighbor data item for a higher level region can be produced by selecting between near neighbor pixels indicated by near neighbor data items for subregions at the next lower level, by choosing the near neighbor pixel that is nearer. The quadrants can be asymmetric so that each pixel is not included in any of its four quadrants and so that the quadrants do not overlap. To provide accurate near neighbor data for a black pixel, the near neighbor data can be shifted to the black pixel from the adjacent pixels, each at the origin of one of its quadrants. Offsets in the near neighbor data can also be adjusted accordingly. Each processing unit can store a bit vector such that the bit vectors together indicate the paths between neighbor pixels and owner pixels, to facilitate subsequent communication between owners and neighbors. Each bit of the bit vector can indicate, for each level of the hierarchy, which of the processing unit's children is on the path at the next lower level.

The network after training becomes a fuzzy/belief network; the inference and weight are exchangeable, and as a result, knowledge extraction becomes simple.

["Overall graphics performance in a computer graphics system is improved by an accelerated interface between high performance microprocessors and hardware adapters which is a combination of hardware and software and which is independent of specific computer languages. The interface was specifically designed for any hardware attached to a central processing unit (CPU) that does not enforce the order of memory accesses. The hardware supported process fools the CPU into thinking that the write and read are accessing the same address, thus guaranteeing that the order of the write and read are correct. In a first method, a hardware pseudo-address are created on the display adapter. When the software writes to the pseudo-address, the display adapter writes the data to the coordinate register. When the software reads from the pseudo-address, the display adapter returns the contents of the actual status address. In the second method, the software writes and reads from the coordinate address; however, when the software reads from the coordinate address, the display adapter does not return the contents of the coordinate address. Instead, the adapter actually reads and returns the contents of the status address.", "Accelerated interface between processors and hardware adapters "]
