["A system is provided to reduce noise from a signal of speech that is contaminated by noise. The present system employs an artificial intelligence that is capable of deciding upon the adjustment of a filter subsystem by distinguishing between noise and speech in the spectrum of the incoming signal of speech plus noise. The system does this by testing the pattern of a power or envelope function of the frequency spectrum of the incoming signal. The system determines that the fast changing portions of that envelope denote speech whereas the residual is determined to be the frequency distribution of the noise power. This determination is done while examining either the whole spectrum, or frequency bands thereof, regardless of where the maximum of the spectrum lies. In another embodiment of the invention, a feedback loop is incorporated which provides incremental adjustments to the filter by employing a gradient search procedure to attempt to increase certain speech-like features in the system's output. The present system does not require consideration of minima of functions of the incoming signal or pauses in speech. Instead, the present system employs an artificial intelligence system to which is input the envelope pattern of the incoming signal of speech and noise. The present system then filters out of this envelope signal the rapidly changing variations of the envelope over fixed time windows.", "Artificial intelligence pattern-recognition-based noise reduction system for speech processing "]

["A system is disclosed that provides an interactive rewards-based method that uses a protocol for instructional response in order to provide a motivating, individualized educational and entertaining experience. The system utilizes an interface through a computer. The system offers the user (a.k.a. student) simulated environments that represent different realities and an opportunity to solve interesting problems and learning puzzles. When the user inputs a response this calls forth a system response using the built-in Intelligent Mentor, thereby teaching the user. The iterative response process provides the user opportunities to discovery before proceeding to a higher level of the subject material. The pedagogical system uses neural nets (engine of artificial intelligence) that drive responses that are synchronized to typographical and graphical illustrations and/or pictorial illustrations used to simulate reality and to provide dynamic interactions. Stages of progression are integrated into the pedagogical system in order to provide users with individually paced experiences determined by the level of difficulty and rate of performance per time period. Users' interaction involves real-time decision-making and fusion of the educational material. It involves programs in computer medium that create a rewards-based system to provide a motivating educational and/or entertainment environment including natural attractions that further motivate continuous involvement in the learning process. Encoded lessons are enabled in the system that provide feedback on aspects of user performance such as mission management, mathematical solutions, recognition, matching, and utilizing data to solve problems and puzzles. The user receives credits each time he/she successfully completes a section. Credits are additive and may be exchanged for material rewards by using this invention of the \u201cvirtual mall\u201d for the computer network. The rewards redemption system includes a server in communication with the users computer mechanism to form a network that may include the Internet. The credits may be saved or can be exchanged for material reward certificates. If redeemed, the student player is dispensed a specific verifiable reward acknowledgement. The computer system can also provide for competition games played for a rivalry of credits by a number of users. Reward information, such as reward costs in terms of specific credit redemption is automatically determined by the system. While this invention has been described in terms of several embodiments, it is contemplated that alterations, variations and equivalents thereof will become apparent to those skilled in the art of pedagogy upon a reading of the specification and study of the drawings. For example, many types of problems/solution sets and puzzles can be provided for use with the disclosed rewards based system, and the computer tool can be utilized for classroom teaching as well. Thus variations can be used. It is noted that the rewards-based system of redemption can be implemented on a single computer connected to other computers, with or without use of the Internet. However, the preferred embodiment illustrated here envisions that the invention will be used in a broad network such as the Internet. The provision of rewards can be achieved by redemption certificates or electronically.

The present system employs an artificial intelligence that is capable of deciding upon the adjustment of a filter subsystem by distinguishing between noise and speech in the spectrum of the incoming signal of speech plus noise.   The system does this by testing the pattern of a power or envelope function of the frequency spectrum of the incoming signal.   The system determines that the fast changing portions of that envelope denote speech whereas the residual is determined to be the frequency distribution of the noise power. This determination is done while examining either the whole spectrum, or frequency bands thereof, regardless of where the maximum of the spectrum lies.In another embodiment of the invention, a feedback loop is incorporated which provides incremental adjustments to the filter by employing a gradient search procedure to attempt to increase certain speech-like features in the system's output.The present system does not require consideration of minima of functions of the incoming signal or pauses in speech.

["The present invention relates to an artificial neural network (ANN) representation for system dynamics models (SDMs) and its applications in model construction and policy design. It first shows that, by a special design of the mapping scheme, a given flow diagram (FD) (i.e., traditional representation) can be transformed into a corresponding model in the representation of partial recurrent networks (PRNs) that will correctly behave like the one it mimics. The present invention shows the equivalence of the two types of representations, both structurally and mathematically. With the additional representation, an automatic learning method that can assist in the construction of SDMs is proposed, which starts from an initial skeleton of a PRN (mapping from an initial FD), identifies the cause-effect relationships within the SDM by neural learning, and then converts it back to the corresponding FD. The composite approach makes model construction simpler and more systematic. Similarly, by assigning an intended behavior pattern as a set of training examples for a given SDM, it can learn a new system structure with the PRN representation; the differences between the original and new structures lead to considerations of policy design. Besides, one can also allow the learning process to restart after some period of using a model so that it has a chance to evolve and adapt to temporal changes in the environment. This touches an area that has not yet been well solved; i.e., feedback to a system might change not only its behavior but also the internal system structure since, for example, a social system is usually organic.", "Neural network representation for system dynamics models, and its applications "]

A network is adjusted to operate in a weighted configuration defined by a set of weight values and a plurality of training patterns are input to the network to generate evaluations of the training patterns as network outputs.
