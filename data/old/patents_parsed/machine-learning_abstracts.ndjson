["A new algorithm for reinforcement learning, advantage updating, is proposed. Advantage updating is a direct learning technique; it does not require a model to be given or learned. It is incremental, requiring only a constant amount of calculation per time step, independent of the number of possible actions, possible outcomes from a given action, or number of states. Analysis and simulation indicate that advantage updating is applicable to reinforcement learning systems working in continuous time (or discrete time with small time steps) for which Q-learning is not applicable. Simulation results are presented indicating that for a simple linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem with no noise and large time steps, advantage updating learns slightly faster than Q-learning. When there is noise or small time steps, advantage updating learns more quickly than Q-learning by a factor of more than 100,000. Convergence properties and implementation issues are discussed. New convergence results are presented for R-learning and algorithms based upon change in value.

["A system that concurrently provides multiple user interface (UI) mechanisms that facilitate control of an application state machine (e.g., unified message system). More particularly, the invention can create two relatively distinct user experiences, one via dual tone multi-frequency (DTMF) navigation and another through speech recognition navigation of a unified message system. In accordance therewith, one single underlying state machine can be used. Navigation and flow control (e.g., state transitions) in the state machine can be leveraged by multiple UI mechanisms that actively co-exist. The invention introduces speech recognition features together with other input mechanisms to drive the UI of an application state machine (e.g., unified messaging system).

["Machine translation decoding is accomplished by receiving as input a text segment in a source language to be translated into a target language, generating an initial translation as a current target language translation, applying one or more modification operators to the current target language translation to generate one or more modified target language translations, determining whether one or more of the modified target language translations represents an improved translation in comparison with the current target language translation, setting a modified target language translation as the current target language translation, and repeating these steps until occurrence of a termination condition.

["A fast variational on-line learning technique for training a transformed hidden Markov model. A simplified general model and an associated estimation algorithm is provided for modeling visual data such as a video sequence. Specifically, once the model has been initialized, an expectation-maximization (\u201cEM\u201d) algorithm is used to learn the one or more object class models, so that the video sequence has high marginal probability under the model. In the expectation step (the \u201cE-Step\u201d), the model parameters are assumed to be correct, and for an input image, probabilistic inference is used to fill in the values of the unobserved or hidden variables, e.g., the object class and appearance.
