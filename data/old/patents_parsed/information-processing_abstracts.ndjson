The technique has wide application in the general field of image enhancement and more particularly in the fields of microscopy, radiology, remote sensing, astronomy, robotics and machine vision and general image evaluation, quantitation and communication. The new image intensity processing technology of this invention makes possible a separation of the image intensity information into three objective distinct non-random spacial groups of \"large image features/background\" and small \"spacial detail\" and \"intensity detail\", and one group of random spacial information of the \"image noise\". \"Detail enhancement\" allows a recovery of intensity-defined image components, eliminated by a pixel-accurate smoothing process, through subtraction of a smoothed image from another smoothed image or the original image. The overall contrast range of the recovered information is equal to the applied smoothing factor and can be automatically brought to the full visual intensity range by linear contrast stretching. This has the advantage of maintaining detail contrast proportions which closely reflect the raw data characteristics. If high pixel accuracy processing is provided, \"detail slicing\" becomes possible. Two smoothed images, each processed with a different smoothing factor, can be subtracted providing the information difference between least smoothed and the most smoothed data set.", "Digital pixel-accurate intensity processing method for image information enhancement "]

["A SAM receives a secure container in which content data encrypted with content key data, the encrypted content key data, and UCP data designating a handling policy of the content data are stored, and determines at least one of the purchase mode and the usage mode of the content data based on the UCP data. The SAM serves as a slave for a host CPU, and is also provided with a common memory shared with the host CPU.", "Data processing apparatus, data processing system, and data processing method therefor "]
["A system processes packetized program information, from different broadcast sources, containing programs and program specific information including associated content rating data. A program specific parameter of a desired program is selected based on its source from equivalent parameters from alternative broadcast sources. The desired program is processed for display, recording or playback using the selected program specific parameter. The selected program specific parameter may comprise a content rating that is mapped to a different program content rating system and used in multi-level validation of authorization to access the desired program.", "System for processing programs and program content rating information derived from multiple broadcast sources "]
["The present invention relates to a system and method for data collection, evaluation, information generation and/or presentation. More particularly the present invention relates to a system for collecting, evaluating, and presenting data relating to electronic commerce. The system and methods of the present invention include one or more of the following: a module for stabilizing small or noisy samples of data, including the prediction of missing observations; alarm modules that alert an event handler when data values and/or rates cross specified thresholds; predictor modules that use recent historical data along with an estimated and/or available population function as the basis for a differential equation that defines the growth of the population to a saturation or maximum attainable level; and a dynamic icon that conveys to users of a system levels of predefined and/or observed activity occurring on the system.", "System and method for data collection, evaluation, information generation, and presentation "]
["An information recording medium of this invention has a first area which records common information which can be commonly played back by a plurality of types of information playback apparatuses provided by different manufacturers or distributors and complies with common standards, a second area which records specific information which can be played back by only an information playback apparatus of a specific type provided by a specific manufacturer or distributor, and a third area which records link information indicating the links between the common information and specific information.", "Information recording medium, information recording method and apparatus, and information playback method and apparatus "]
["A system and method that enhances the \u201cfocus\u201d of information exchanged between sellers and buyers. Buyers identify potential sources for goods and services that are desirable to the buyer. Buyers can focus their access to listings of seller information by identifying desirable attributes, including but not limited to: geography attributes relating to the location(s) of the seller; and category attributes relating to the various categories of offerings that interest to the buyer. The use of geographical and categorical attributes is not limited to their inclusion as part of the search terms. Instead, seller listings can be organized into hierarchies of geography-based and category-based attributes in a highly normalized fashion to enhance the ability of a buyer focus on the most desirable listings. The system can be configured to limit, order, or otherwise prioritize the information viewed by the buyer on the basis of the desired attributes identified by the buyer.", "Information distribution system "]
["In a multimedia information and control system for use in an automobile, at least one interface is employed which enables a user to access information concerning the automobile and control vehicle functions in an efficient manner. The user may select one of a plurality of displayed options on a screen of such an interface. Through audio, video and/or text media, the user is provided with information concerning the selected option and the vehicle function corresponding thereto. Having been so informed, the user may activate the selected option to control the corresponding vehicle function.", "Technique for effectively searching for information in a vehicle "]
