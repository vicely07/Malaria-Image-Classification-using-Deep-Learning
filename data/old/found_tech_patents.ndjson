["Neural network based methods and systems for analyzing complex data ", "Fully automated methods and systems for processing complex data sets to identify abnormalities are described. In one embodiment, the system includes wavelet processing, recursive processing to determine prominent features, and then utilizing feed forward neural networks (FFNNs) to classify feature vectors generated in the wavelet and recursive processing. With respect to wavelet processing, multiresolution (five-level) and multidirection (two-dimensional) wavelet analysis with quadratic spline wavelets is performed to transform each image. The wavelets are a first-order derivative of a smoothing function and enhance the edges of image objects. Because two-dimensional wavelet transforms quantize an image in terms of space and spatial frequency and can be ordered linearly, the data is processed recursively to determine prominent features. A neural network approach derived from sequential recursive auto-associative memory is then used to parse the wavelet coefficients and hierarchy data. Since the wavelet coefficients are continuous, linear output instead of sigmoidal output is used. This variation is therefore referred to as linear output sequential recursive auto-associative memory, or LOSRAAM. The objective of training the LOSRAAM network is to have the output exactly match the input. Context units arising from serial evaluation of the wavelet coefficient triplets may be collected as vectors. These vectors are subjected to cluster analysis. This analysis yields a number of identifiable and discrete states. From these states, feature vectors are created. Each element in the feature vector represents the number of times the corresponding state from the above cluster analysis is found. Then, feed forward neural networks (FFNNs) are trained to classify feature vectors."]

A conventional gradient descent algorithm is employed to update the neural network parameters at the end of the predetermined time interval. The foregoing process is repeated in repetitive cycles until the actual output vector corresponds to the target vector. In the preferred embodiment, as the overall error of the neutral network output decreases during successive training cycles, the portion of the error fed back to the output neurons is decreased accordingly, allowing the network to learn with greater freedom from teacher forcing as the network parameters converge to their optimum values.

Subsequent to the gradient propagation, the weights can be normalized, thereby preventing convergence to a local optimum. Education of the network can be incremental both on and off-line.

["Methods and apparatus for verifying the originator of a sequence of operations ", "Speaker verification is important in such applications as financial transactions which are to be carried out automatically by telephone. False acceptances of a speaker cause serious problems but so do frequent false rejections in view of the annoyance caused. Some of the problems of speaker verification are reduced in the invention by forming Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for each of a number of words using features of utterances of these words from a large number of speakers. These models are known as world models. In addition, for every person whose speech is to be recognized, one HMM is formed for each of the words as uttered by that person. These models are known as personal models. In verification, a person is prompted to repeat a string of isolated or connected words (15) and features from each of these words are extracted (16). Next, the probabilities that these features could have been generated by the world models for these words and by the personal model of that person are calculated, respectively (17 and 18) and these probabilities are compared (19) for each word. A decision (23) on verification is based on a poll (22) of these comparisons."]

The network F2 activates compressed recognition close that are predictive with respect to the activation patterns flickering across F1, and competitively inhibits, or masks, codes which are unpredictive with respect to the F1 patterns. The masking field can simultaneously detect multiple groupings within its input patterns and assign activation weights to the recognition codes for these groupings which are predictive with respect to the contextual information embedded within the patterns and the prior learning of the network.

The training data, test data and live data may be stored in a storage device. Training data may then be pre-processed in order to add meaning thereto. Pre-processing data may involve transforming the data points and/or expanding the data points.
