"Muscular development of an athlete is achieved for increasing the starting acceleration and stroke speed when an athlete initiates a movement stroke such as a punch from a boxer's arm, throwing a baseball pitch or kicking a football, etc. by the means and method of this invention. Thus, the initial movement of the athlete is restrained with an external force of predetermined magnitude which is released in response to the athlete's movement overcoming the restraining force. Thus, those muscles are developed which are used in initiating motion so that they deliver greater initial acceleration to attain higher stroking speed which is converted to an impact blow of greater force. An exercise machine for such muscular training provides the initial but releasable restraining force by means of two separable magnetically attracted members having the predetermined initial force adjustably varied by introducing a variable air gap distance between the magnetically attracted members. The machine is flexibly mounted on an anchored base to permit movement of the athlete in a three dimensional stroke pattern.

Preferably, players are afforded an option at an intermediate step in game play, after a first one-half inning, to either drop out and forfeit their initial wager, or to continue play by placing a second wager. In a second embodiment, an electronic video slot type machine intended for play by a single player, or by multiple players taking turns in succession, operates under program control to display baseball """"at bat"""" events, associated odds, and separate wagering options on first and second portions of a video display. The second portion of the video display provides an optional """"home run"""" attempt and associated wager which does not affect play of the game on the first display portion.

"An approach to realistically schematizing professional team sports embodied as board games, and particularly a preferred embodiment schematizing American football, baseball and basketball, as well as soccer, ice hockey and golf. One key to the realistic play of the game is the On-The-Roll™ (“OTR”) mechanism where, once play begins, real time play continues, generally against a clock, where both teams, generally, continue to roll dice continuing sub-play actions or elements, until a play is completed, as by a touchdown, tackle, or otherwise. Other games employ a one-player OTR mechanism for processes such as putting or hazard escape in golf. An additional essential element is a series of rules and charts, based on statistical compilation of many actual professional games, that map various combinations of offensive and defensive strategy options and dice rolls onto realistic game situations and the progression among them. Further, a mechanism is often employed where both teams: secretly choose a strategy, generally by selecting a card placed face down; roll one or more dice; reveal strategy choices by turning cards face up; determine a situation chart to consult, and further determine which result is selected from within the chart, based on some combination of which cards were played and the results of the dice rolls. An additional element is a variety of play cards that effect the overall game momentum of either team. Additional authenticity is achieved in golf, for example, by constructing a variety of dice roll mechanisms and progress rules that each correspond to the specific performance of an environmental or landscaping element such as wind magnitude and direction, ground slant, grass roll speed, and various hazards of diverse properties and difficulties including water, trees, roughs, and sand traps of various depths.",2010-03-30,7686304,Methods and devices for on-the-roll sports games

"A baseball cap including features for stabilizing the cap in a moving stream of air. The cap includes a modified bill having a downforce generator configured to create a relatively stagnate recirculation zone between the downforce generator and the head covering. This recirculation zone tends to negate the lifting effect found in prior art bills. The invention preferably includes a vent through the bill. The vent is located behind the downforce generator, to connect the underside of the bill to the recirculation zone formed in the wake of the downforce generator. The vent is selectively closed by a flexible flap. The flap remains closed to prevent rain from passing through the vent. However, if pressure beneath the bill significantly exceeds pressure above the bill, the vent opens to equalize the pressure. This action prevents the creation of a net lifting force which might lift the cap off the wearer's head.",2014-07-22,8782815,Wind-stabilized baseball cap
